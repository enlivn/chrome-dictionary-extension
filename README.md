Chrome Popup Dictionary
========
This project is a Google Chrome browser dictionary extension for improving second-language vocabulary learning. It uses the WordReference API and the Chrome Extension Framework.

Features:

* Supports the French language

* Enables users to quickly look up word meanings by holding down the control button on the keyboard and double-clicking a word to get its meaning in a popup.

* Allows saving meanings of looked up words to a list that is stored in memory. The next time the user is on that page, words previously looked up show up highlighted as well as in the extension (serving as a memory aid).

The advantages are:

* less distraction from normal browsing and less effort as compared to navigating to a dictionary website and looking up the word

* word list provides readily-accessible memory aid.
