        <p>
        <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> is designed to help foreign language learners better remember new vocabulary they acquire online.
        The idea behind it is very simple: <em>repetition</em> and <em>context</em> are key to remembering new words
        that we learn, especially when they are words in a foreign language.
        </p>

        <p>
        Although there are a number of excellent
        dictionary websites online, one major problem is that once we have looked up a word and then moved on to a new page,
        we usually tend to forget the word we looked up. A number of times, you might find yourself looking up the
        same word from different webpages and only remembering that you have actually looked the word up before
        <em>after</em> you have checked up on its meaning. This can be frustrating. <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> aims to solve this
        problem by:
        <ul>
          <li> Maintaining an easily-accessible list of words that you have looked up. Although you could use an
               external program like a Word processor or flashcard software to do this, <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> gives you the
               word list functionality right in your browser, just two clicks away at all times!</li>
          <li> Saving the context of words (the sentence they were found in) when you look them up.
               The context of the word is often a very good memory aid.</li>
          <li> Highlighting on any page the words you have looked up (even if they were looked up
               from other pages). This means you can challenge yourself to remember what the words mean. And
               if you don't remember, <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> can always remind you! ;)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        What's more, <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> does all this without disturbing your normal browsing experience. <em>You</em>
        turn on the features you want, when <em>you</em> want it.
        </p>
        <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> is currently aimed at individuals learning French.

          <p>
          A quick look at the extension icon will
          tell you whether <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> is on or off, as the following image shows
          (see part enclosed in blue rectangle). If it says 'ON', the extension is active.
          </p>
          <center>
            <img src='help/extensionOn.png'/>
          </center>
          <p>
          If it says 'OFF', you need to turn the extension on. To do so, click on the icon and toggle the status button,
          as shown in the following figure (see parts enclosed in blue rectangles).
          </p>
          <center>
            <img src='help/turnedOffOn.png'/>
          </center>
          </p>
          <p>
          You need to do this only ONCE for
          every browsing session (until the browser is closed and reopened). Turning off the extension is equally easy.
          Simply toggle the Status button again.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='yourPoison' id='lookingUpWordsDiv'>
          <p>
          <b>Make sure <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> is turned ON first.</b> Hover over
          'Turning popupDic On/Off'  above if you're not sure about how to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
          To look up word meanings, hold down the 'Alt' key on your keyboard and double-click the word you
          wish to look up. The meaning of the word pops up on the page, as shown in the figure below. It's as simple
          as that!
          </p>
          <center>
            <img src='help/meaningPopup.png'/>
          </center>
          <p>
          Click outside the popup or on the 'cross' icon to close the popup.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='yourPoison' id='sidebarDiv'>
          <p>
          <b>Make sure <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> is turned ON first.</b> Hover over
          'Turning popupDic On/Off'  above if you're not sure about how to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
          The sidebar displays a list of words you have looked up before. The sidebar is not displayed by default.
          To turn it on, toggle the 'Sidebar' switch after clicking on the extension icon, as the image below shows (see
          parts enclosed in blue rectangles).
          </p>
          <center>
            <img src='help/sidebarOffOn.png'/>
          </center>
          <p>
          If the page is refreshed, the sidebar will turn off and you must turn it back on again. Sidebar's must also
          be toggled individually for each webpage. This is so that it interferes as little as possible with your
          normal browsing.
          </p>
          <p>
          The sidebar also saves the context the word was found in as a gloss (memory aid). You can see the
          context by clicking on the bulb icon, as the following image shows (see part enclosed in blue
          rectangles). Clicking on the bulb again will
          hide the gloss.
          </p>
          <center>
            <img src='help/sidebarDetails.png'/>
          </center>
          <p>
          'Clear List' will clear all words from the extension's memory. <b><em>Be careful as this cannot be
              undone!</em></b>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='yourPoison' id='highlightingDiv'>
          <p>
          <b>Make sure <span class='popupDic'>popupDic</span> is turned ON first.</b> Hover over
          'Turning popupDic On/Off'  above if you're not sure about how to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
          Highlighting will help you exercise your memory. Turn it on/off by toggling the 'Highlighting' button
          after clicking on the extension icon, as the image below shows (see part enclosed in blue rectangles).
          </p>
          <center>
            <img src='help/highlightingOffOn.png'/>
          </center>
          <p>
          Like the sidebar, highlighting must be turned on and off individually for each page. Additionally, refreshing
          the page will remove the highlighting and you must turn it on again if you want it.
          </p>
          <p>
          When Highlighting is on, words you have looked up before (on <em>any</em> page) will be highlighted on the current
          page. You can check if you remember what they mean.
          </p>
          <p>
          Hovering over a word shows a popup that asks precisely
          this question.
          <ul>
            <li>If you do remember the meaning, simply move the mouse away and the popup will disappear.</li>
            <li>If you don't remember the meaning, clicking on 'No' will display it for you, as the image below
            shows. You can then close the popup by clicking on the 'Close' icon or anywhere outside the
            popup.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
